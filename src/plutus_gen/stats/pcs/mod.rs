//! PCS (Polynomial Commitment Scheme) cost estimation abstractions.
//!
//! [`PcsEstimate`] is implemented for each supported PCS and drives two phases of the
//! verifier cost model:
//!
//! 1. **Transcript reading** — `read_transcript` accounts for the opening proof elements
//!    that are read from the proof transcript (challenges, commitments, evaluations).
//!
//! 2. **Opening computation** — `compute_opening` accounts for the scalar multiplications
//!    needed to evaluate the batched polynomial opening (powers of the batching challenges).
//!
//! Currently only [`H2MO`] (Halo2 multi-open) is supported.
