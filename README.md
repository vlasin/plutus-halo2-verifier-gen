## Overview

This project bridges Rust-based Halo2 implementations with Plutus smart contracts on Cardano. It
extracts verification keys and circuit structures from Halo2 circuits and generates corresponding verifier code
in either **Plinth** (Haskell-based) or **Aiken** (Rust-like functional smart contract language) that can validate
proofs on-chain.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Halo2 proof generation in Rust** (`src/`)
    - Circuit definitions and implementations
    - Proof generation and verification

2. **Plutus Generation Pipeline** (`src/plutus_gen/`)
    - `extraction/`: Extracts circuit data from Halo2 structures
    - `code_emitters_plinth.rs`: Generates Plinth code from Handlebars templates optimized for specific circuits
    - `code_emitters_aiken.rs`: Generates Aiken code from Handlebars templates optimized for specific circuits

3. **Plinth Verifier** (`plinth-verifier/`)
    - Common Plinth code for Halo2 verification
    - Handlebars template files for circuit-tailored code generation

4. **Aiken Verifier** (`aiken-verifier/`)
    - Common Aiken code for Halo2 verification (BLS12-381 operations, MSM, KZG commitments)
    - Handlebars template files for circuit-tailored code generation
    - Submitter for on-chain testing

### Workflow

1. Define Halo2 circuit in Rust
2. Generate proving/verifying keys
3. Extract circuit structure and constraints
4. Generate optimized verifier code in target language (either Plinth or Aiken)
5. Integrate verifier into smart contract to be deployed on Cardano

## Build prerequisites

The prototype consists of three main parts:

1. **Rust component**: Generates Halo2 proofs and produces verifier code for either Plinth or Aiken
    - Built using standard `cargo` tooling from the root of the repository

2. **Plinth component** (`plinth-verifier/`): Haskell-based smart contract verifier
    - Built using `cabal` in `nix` environment

3. **Aiken component** (`aiken-verifier/aiken_halo2/`): Aiken smart contract verifier
    - Built using `aiken` toolchain

#### How to install and use nix (necessary only for Plinth part)

1. Install `nix` - the package manager

```
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
```

2. Modify the conf file `/etc/nix/nix.conf` by adding

```
substituters = https://cache.nixos.org https://cache.iog.io
trusted-public-keys = hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ= cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
allow-import-from-derivation = "true"
```

3. The contract can be build from the relevant templates folder using the nix shell:

```bash
nix develop github:input-output-hk/devx#ghc96-iog
cd plinth-verifier
cabal build -j all
cabal test all
```

If you have build errors due to missing package descriptions like this:

```bash
.....
Error: cabal: No cabal file found.
Please create a package description file <pkgname>.cabal
Failed to build random-shuffle-0.0.4. The failure occurred during the
configure step.
.....
```

just try to re-run the build (may require several re-runs).

#### How to install and use Aiken

1. Install `aiken` - the Aiken smart contract language toolchain

Follow the installation instructions at https://aiken-lang.org/installation-instructions

2. The Aiken verifier can be built from the aiken-verifier directory:

```bash
cd aiken-verifier/aiken_halo2
aiken check
aiken build
```

## Running Examples

### Rust part (generating verifiers)

The repository includes several example circuits:

* `simple_mul` - Simple multiplication circuit with standard PLONK gates
* `atms` - Advanced ATMS (Aggregate Threshold Multisignature) circuit for aggregating signatures with threshold
  validation. Based on [input-output-hk/sidechains-zk](https://github.com/input-output-hk/sidechains-zk)
* `atms_with_lookups` - A circuit that verifies ATMS signature and lookup argument
* `lookup_table` - A circuit with lookup argument

These circuits can be run in two versions: one using the GWC19 flavor of multi-open KZG, and the other using the
multi-open protocol described in Halo2 book.

```bash
# Simple multiplication circuit (Halo2 KZG)
cargo run --example simple_mul

# Simple multiplication circuit (GWC19 KZG)
cargo run --example simple_mul gwc_kzg

# ATMS (Aggregate Threshold Multisignature) circuit Halo2 KZG
cargo run --example atms

# ATMS (Aggregate Threshold Multisignature) circuit GWC19 KZG
cargo run --example atms gwc_kzg

# ATMS with dummy lookup tables (Halo2 KZG)
cargo run --example atms_with_lookups

# ATMS with dummy lookup tables (GWC19 KZG)
cargo run --example atms_with_lookups gwc_kzg

# Lookup table circuit (Halo2 KZG)
cargo run --example lookup_table

# Simple multiplication circuit (GWC19 KZG)
cargo run --example atms_with_lookups gwc_kzg

# With detailed logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --example simple_mul

# With Plutus traces (note that Plutus traces will increase contract cost!)
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --example simple_mul --features plutus_debug
```

Running an example will generate the verification and proving keys for the circuit, create a proof using test public
inputs, and produce verifier code for **both Plinth and Aiken**. The generated files will be saved in their respective
locations:

**Plinth verifier:**

* The generated proof is saved in `./plinth-verifier/plutus-halo2/test/Generic/serialized_proof.json`.
* The public inputs are saved in `./plinth-verifier/plutus-halo2/test/Generic/serialized_public_inputs.hex`.
* The generated Plinth verifier code is saved in:

```
./plinth-verifier/plutus-halo2/src/Plutus/Crypto/Halo2/Generic/Verifier.hs
./plinth-verifier/plutus-halo2/src/Plutus/Crypto/Halo2/Generic/VKConstants.hs
```

**Aiken verifier:**

* The generated proof is saved in `./aiken-verifier/submitter/serialized_proof.json`.
* The public inputs are saved in `./aiken-verifier/submitter/serialized_public_inputs.hex`.
* The generated Aiken verifier code is saved in:

```
./aiken-verifier/aiken_halo2/lib/proof_verifier.ak
./aiken-verifier/aiken_halo2/lib/vk.ak
```

### Plinth part (running generated Plinth verifier)

After the Rust part is executed you can test the Plinth verifier as follows:

```bash
nix develop github:input-output-hk/devx#ghc96-iog
cd plinth-verifier
cabal build -j all
cabal test all
```

### Aiken part (running generated Aiken verifier)

After the Rust part is executed you can test the Aiken verifier as follows:

```bash
cd aiken-verifier/aiken_halo2
aiken check
aiken build
```

## Benchmarks

Below are the execution costs of both Plinth and Aiken scripts running the Halo2 verifier for various circuits (with
multiopen
KZG variant from GWC19):

| Circuit description             | Script size*</br>Plinth | Script size*</br>Aiken | CPU usage</br>Plinth | CPU usage</br>Aiken | Mem usage</br>Plinth | Mem usage</br>Aiken | 
|---------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Simple mul**                  | 6465  (39.5%)           | 5543  (33.8%)          | 5,1 B  (51%)         | 4,9 B  (49%)        | 3,3 M (23.6%)        | 3,9 M (24.9%)       |
| **Lookup table**                | 12013 (73.3%)           | 9667  (59.0%)          | 8,3 B  (83%)         | 7,9 B  (79%)        | 3,9 M (27.9%)        | 4,5 M (32.1%)       |
| **ATMS (50 out of 90)**         | 12465 (76.1%)           | 10597 (64.7%)          | 8,9 B  (89%)         | 8,8 B  (88%)        | 3,9 M (27.9%)        | 4,5 M (32.1%)       |
| **ATMS (228 out of 408)**       | 12465 (76.1%)           | 10597 (64.7%)          | 8,9 B  (89%)         | 8,8 B  (88%)        | 3,9 M (27.9%)        | 4,5 M (32.1%)       |
| **ATMS (50/90) + lookup table** | 15172 (92.6%)           | 12534 (76.5%)          | 10,6 B (106%)        | 10,4 B (104%)       | 4,3 M (30.7%)        | 5,1 M (36.4%)       |

\* Script size % is taken as a percentage of the 16kb script limit

**Note that the benchmark numbers are approximate.** Even for the same circuit, the verifier's execution cost may vary
slightly depending on the specific proof being verified. This variation stems from the randomness used during proof
generation, which can be influenced by the initial seed or the platform on which the prover runs.

### Axiom SHPLONK scalar multiplication benchmark

The Axiom BLS12-381 SHPLONK benchmark generates a Secp256k1 variable-base scalar multiplication proof, emits Aiken and
Plinth verifiers through the generic Axiom generator, and runs `aiken check` against the generated Aiken verifier:

```bash
RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1 cargo bench --bench axiom_secp_scalar_mul
```

The benchmark prints prover/generator timings and the Aiken `mem`/`cpu` ExUnits for
`valid_axiom_shplonk_proof_benchmark`.

### Further improvements

The upcoming CIP-109 (built-in modular inversion) and CIP-133 (built-in multi-scalar multiplication) are expected to
significantly reduce the on-chain costs of the verifiers.
